Tired of the all-same routine every day? Do you want something more... let's say, special?
Wait no more! Survival Inc. corporation, in association with Steve&Steve industries,
is pleased to present you the newest product in our line!

Survival Inc. mod is a mod focusing on providing generic survival related stats, such as body
heat, hydration, and mental sanity. This mod is mainly focused to make minecraft a little more
challenging, even at late game. All this awesomeness comes thanks to our cooperation with 
Klein Enterprises' "Don't Die-because-you-forgot-to-eat" game. Therefore, all stats in this mod
are at least a little bit influenced by the ones present in their game. And it was totally not a
business espionage, our staff assures you.

## Features
For a list of features, see the [Wiki](https://github.com/Enginecrafter77/SurvivalInc/wiki)

## Contributing
Do you have a great idea in your mind, and wouldn't mind sharing it with the world? Just open an
issue, and I will probably respond withing a week!

### Issues
Issues should be constructive, well-written and formatted. Low-quality issues (confusing title, low-effort text,
no formatting) may and will be formatted by me, so don't be mad if I edit your post. Also, user who submitted an
issue, sould not abadon the issue. Issues with no activity for over a month will be closed as "abadoned", and no
further assistance may be given. Should the submitting user return, they should repoen their issue.

## API
Survival Inc. has been designed with extensibility in mind. As such, it is possible to interact
with it from other mods quite easily. See the wiki and individual pages about what can you access
from your mod.

Read the guide [here](https://github.com/Enginecrafter77/SurvivalInc/wiki/Using-the-API) on setting up
your project with SurvivalInc dependency.

## Legal (Jokes Aside)
The name of the project is a unique name made up by Enginecrafter77. The name was chosen for the survival
nature of the mod's influence on the main game. Any possible match with a real company with name "Survival Inc.",
or a similar-enough name is purely coincidental, and certainly not intended to break trademark law or any
other laws available to be misused.
