/**
 * StatRegisterDispatcher is a factory for {@link StatTracker}s.
 * This class was introduced to grant additional freedom to
 * users willing to extends the functionality of Survival Inc.
 * stat trackers. The StatRegisterDispatcher is designed to be
 * fed to {@link net.minecraftforge.common.capabilities.CapabilityManager#register(Class, Capability.IStorage, Callable)} as the factory callback.
 * Internally, the StatRegisterDispatcher constructs a {@link StatRegisterEvent},
 * which is then broadcasted on the {@link MinecraftForge#EVENT_BUS}.
 * The StatRegisterEvent takes care of registering the {@link StatProvider}s
 * to the stat tracker. When it's done, the stat tracker instance is
 * returned so the capability may be constructed.
